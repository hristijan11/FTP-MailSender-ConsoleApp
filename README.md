#Menu which gives you 3 possible answers (pay attention to the part with password): 1)Send Mail through a console,2)Do FTP on a server and 3) Quit 1# ‚ñ¨So,what first option allows you as a user is asking for typing your email address,ask for adding password,allows you to choose who's gonna be a BCC(BlindCarbonCopy),who's gonna be a CC(CarbonCopy), asking for typing Subject and Body of the message and the final part email who you want to receive the message. *I wanted to mention about the part with the password... Function of EmailSender which i made, it's succesffull only by adding Generated password which i need to give you to access for sending the mail ,is by having a Generated Passowrd, and reason is beacuse i was wondering for privacy and security at begging of the code so that's where i end it.Feel free to share your idea about it -Password is : cxcrcabqcrhmofpj 2# ‚ñ¨Also at the option 2)Do FTP on a server there is one situation where you need to access to specified application which allows you to connect to a server where you can work with files. -Which means,you need to have Fille Zilla and implement the correct credentials to the server. which they are inside code ‚ñ¨Next part is where i put class for CRUD-CreateReadeUpdateDelete and plus checking if the file exists in the Server ‚ñ¨Doing this process i had a proper Menu with switch cases and implemented methods for linking the pages. 3# Adding enviorment method for automathically close the program. #Feel free to share your thoughts,hope you enjoy it.
