- 🔭 I’m currently working on **FTP_EmailSender**

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/hristijan11](https://github.com/hristijan11)

#The project containts a menu, which gives you 3 possible answers (pay attention to the part with password): 
1)Send Mail through a console,
2)Do FTP on a server
3)The first option allows you to set BCC(BlindCarbonCopy) and CC(CarbonCopy) for the mail, asking for typing Subject and Body of the message and the final part is the person you want to send the message.
4) *Password for this project is cxcrcabqcrhmofpj
▬Also at the option 
10)You need to have Fille Zilla and implement the correct credentials to the server, which they are inside code 
▬Next part is where i put class for CRUD-CreateReadeUpdateDelete and plus checking if the file exists in the Server 
5)   #Feel free to share your thoughts,hope you enjoy it.
