# FTPMailSenderApp
#Menu which gives you 3 possible answers : 1)Send Mail through a console,2)Do FTP on a server and 3) Quit
#So,what first option allows you as a user is Adding email who sends the email,adding password,allows you to choose who's gonna be a BCC(Blind Carbon Copy),who's gonna be a CC , asking for enterying Subject and Body for the message and the final part email who you want to receive the message.
-I wanted to mention about the password...Function of email sender which i made is succesffull only by adding Generated password which i need to give you to access the sending mail , and reason is beacuse i was wondering for privacy and security at begging of the code so that's where i end it.So yes, you need to text me for the generated password and you can send,in future i can create to do by default without Less Secure App or 2-Authentications.
#Also at the option 2)Do FTP on a server there is one situation where you need to access to specified application which allows you to connect to a server where you can work with files.
It's only for testing is it working and boosting skills not to mess up anything out there.*Just to mention it.*
